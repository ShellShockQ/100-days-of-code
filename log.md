# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Round1 Day 1: Jan. 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Posted a placeholder website to my domain name

**Thoughts:** It's nothing major, but I setup a site on IIS on AWS. I had a few issues with the FTP site, but I worked them out.

### Round1 Day 2: Jan. 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I posted schedule a FB frame for MLK's birthday and I updated the photo on my personal website

**Thoughts:** I don't really like that photo but I allowed me to get a little practice working with CSS and images as backgrounds.
